Show what I’m listening from Last.fm

## Draft to make the README

“Show current music track”.

Sharing the music track to which you're listening

If you'd like to show your contacts what music you're listening to at that very moment, select Show current music track from the Available or Busy section of your status drop-down menu.

Your status will automatically update each time your supported music player starts a new song, listing the track name and artist information:

If you stop your music, your status will display the default Available or Busy message.

#Supported players for sharing my music status
We currently support the latest version of the following music players: 

    iTunes
    Windows Media Player
    Winamp
    Yahoo Music Engine

We hope to add support for additional music players in the future.
